# About the web app

This is my first ASP.NET MVC web-application made as a course project on C# courses in ITMO University. 
This app is dedicated to the Vigen√®re cipher. It has a decryptor and an encoder for text from txt and docx files.
____
## Features:

Main page reminds you what you can do in this application.
There is a page for __encrypting__ text, uploaded as txt/docx file or entered by user. 
Also you can __decrypt__ a text using the same technology.
You can __download result as txt or docx document__ in the folder you want.
There is also help page with some instructions.
And __about__ page, where you can find my thanks words to Alexander Isaev!
